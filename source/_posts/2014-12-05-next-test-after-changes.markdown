Self-education isn't easy... It's all about consistency and finding right sources to learning from. Is a hard nut to crack to find out appropriate ones. Without a doubt, for completely begginers (moi for example) I recommend searching open-source courses, books, videos, podcasts and what is more important - looking for opinions from expirienced programmers. It's crucial thing, becouse most of founded sources are overdue or sketchy-prepared - couple of minutes sacrified for reading review could save precious time for education.

Do you see any Teletubbies in here? Do you see a slender plastic tag clipped to my shirt with my name printed on it? Do you see a little Asian child with a blank expression on his face sitting outside on a mechanical helicopter that shakes when you put quarters in it? No? Well, that's what you see at a toy store. And you must think you're in a toy store, because you're here shopping for an infant named Jeb.
