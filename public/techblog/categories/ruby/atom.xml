<h5>1. Listen to people smarter than yourself </h5>
<p>Self-education isn’t easy… It’s all about consistency and finding right sources to learning from. Is a hard nut to crack to find out appropriate ones. Without a doubt, for completely begginers (moi for example) I recommend searching open-source courses, books, videos, podcasts and what is more important - looking for opinions from expirienced programmers. It’s crucial thing, becouse most of founded sources are overdue or sketchy-prepared - couple of minutes sacrified for reading review could save precious time for education.  </p>

<h5>Are you ready for the truth?</h5>
<p>Look, just because I don’t be givin’ no man a foot massage don’t make it right for Marsellus to throw Antwone into a glass motherfuckin’ house, fuckin’ up the way the nigger talks. Motherfucker do that shit to me, he better paralyze my ass, ‘cause I’ll kill the motherfucker, know what I’m sayin’?</p>

<h5>No, motherfucker</h5>
<p>Do you see any Teletubbies in here? Do you see a slender plastic tag clipped to my shirt with my name printed on it? Do you see a little Asian child with a blank expression on his face sitting outside on a mechanical helicopter that shakes when you put quarters in it? No? Well, that’s what you see at a toy store. And you must think you’re in a toy store, because you’re here shopping for an infant named Jeb.</p>

<h5>Hold on to your butts</h5>
<p>Your bones don’t break, mine do. That’s clear. Your cells react to bacteria and viruses differently than mine. You don’t get sick, I do. That’s also clear. But for some reason, you and I react the exact same way to water. We swallow it too fast, we choke. We get some in our lungs, we drown. However unreal it may seem, we are connected, you and I. We’re on the same curve, just on opposite ends.</p>

<h5>Is she dead, yes or no?</h5>
<p>The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the iniquities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men. Blessed is he who, in the name of charity and good will, shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness, for he is truly his brother’s keeper and the finder of lost children. And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger those who would attempt to poison and destroy My brothers. And you will know My name is the Lord when I lay My vengeance upon thee.</p>
